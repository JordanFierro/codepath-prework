## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

WhatsApp
- End-to-end encryption
- AI sticker generation
- Call, message, video chat with anyone with a connection around the world

Fanduel
- Clean UI that's easy to follow
- Promotions aren't annoyingly in your face
- Most popular events are at the top

Discord
- Customizable design
- UI is easy to follow
- Very customizable notifications

Chess.com
- Clean and easy to follow uI
- Variety of ways to play

App I would like to build
- There is an app called StatMuse that allows you to search up any statistic in most sports. There is also an app called Prop.Cash. This app uses sports data to visualize stastics in a friendly UI. I'd love to be able to make an app that combines these two apps together. Having a "Google" like search engine while also having a visually appealing UI to display all the statstics would be great. I'd like to be able to generate graphs to display the relevant statistics that the user is searching up. I've also wanted to make this app because both of those apps are locked behind a paywall. I think a free or one-time payment would be perfect.

## Notes

- Had trouble with the button logic for a bit. I fixed it by noticing I had another instance of the function that I had forgotten to delete.
- I am new to github so I had to follow along. Although it was easy to figure out.
